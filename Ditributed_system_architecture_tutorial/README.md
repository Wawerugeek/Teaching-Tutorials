Install PlantUML Rendering Tool:

You need a tool that can interpret PlantUML scripts and generate diagrams. You can use one of the following options:

<strong> Online Editors: </strong>

Websites like <a href="https://www.planttext.com/">PlantText </a> allow you to input PlantUML code and instantly see the generated diagram. You can copy paste the code there

<strong> Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): <strong>

Some IDEs, such as Visual Studio Code with the PlantUML extension, support PlantUML. Install the extension and create a new PlantUML file with your code.

<strong> Command-Line Tools:</strong>

You can use command-line tools like plantuml to generate diagrams. Install PlantUML on your machine, save the script in a file (e.g., diagram.puml), and run a command like: plantuml diagram.puml
